## TODO

### 1. Create unit tests

### 2. Fix Directory folder

#### 2.1 Goal: Not putting everything in Classes folder. Creating some more structure. 

* For me to achieve my goal to create a gaming platform, there will need to be a change of structure of the project. 
I want to go in the direction of reusing code functionality. So making some abstract classes will be necessary. 
Following this idea, the ideal structure (i think) will look something like this:
  * Gaming platform 
    * assets (For storing fonts, images, sounds, etc)
    * games (Placing the games itself in here.)
      * TicTacToe
        * __ init__.py
        * tic_tac_toe.py
        * assets
      * Battleships
        *  --||--
      * Chess
        * --||--
    * utility
      * __ init__.py
      * common.py
    * __ init __ 
    * main.py
    * menu.py

### 3. Creating the environment to play and use the platform by hosting it locally.
