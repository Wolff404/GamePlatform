# Game Platform! 

This project is for me to learn, explore, and stay engaged with programming while having fun!

I'm not aiming for perfection. The main objective is to make it work the way I want.

My idea is to create a small local gaming platform where you can play Tic-Tac-Toe, Battleships, and Chess!
